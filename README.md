# Grade-Needed
## Problem Description
One question I get asked frequently is "What grade do I need to get on my final to get an X in the class?" For this assignment you will be writing a program to answer that question.

You should ask the user for the following in this order

The letter grade they want to get in the class
What percent they need to get in the class to get that grade
(A value from 0 - 100. It may not be a whole number)
What percent you currently have in the class
(A value from 0 - 100. It may not be a whole number)
The weight of the final.
(A value from 0 - 100. It may not be a whole number)
After gathering the above information your program should output what percent the user needs to get on the final to achieve the desired grade.

## Requirements
Your Program must compile with the -Wall, -Werror, and -Wextra options enabled
Use doubles and not floats for all numbers that could have a decimal point in them
Print all double to 2 decimal places
Assumptions
All input is valid
Examples
In the examples below user input has been placed in italics. You don't have to make your input italicized, it is just there to help you differentiate between what is input and what is output.

## Example 1
Enter the grade you want in the class: B

Enter the percent you need to get that grade: 80

Enter your current percent in the class: 75

Enter the weight of the final: 20

You need to get at least 100.00% on the final to get a B in the class.

## Example 2
Enter the grade you want in the class: A

Enter the percent you need to get that grade: 90

Enter your current percent in the class: 83

Enter the weight of the final: 30

You need to get at least 106.33% on the final to get a A in the class.

## Example 3
Enter the grade you want in the class: B

Enter the percent you need to get that grade: 85

Enter your current percent in the class: 72

Enter the weight of the final: 50

You need to get at least 98.00% on the final to get a B in the class.

## Example 4
Enter the grade you want in the class: B

Enter the percent you need to get that grade: 80

Enter your current percent in the class: 90

Enter the weight of the final: 5

You need to get at least -110.00% on the final to get a B in the class.
